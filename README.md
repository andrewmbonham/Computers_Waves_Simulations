# Computers, Waves, Simulations Specialization:
# A Practical Introduction to Numerical Methods using Python
## Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München (LMU)

Contents of repository:

### Pseudospectral Methods
### Spectral Element Methos

## Description
This course by LMU involved building numerical python tools to solve partial 
differential equations. This repository contains a selection of the labs. 
The efficiency of various ODE/PDE methods were compared for several problems. 
Dynamic plotting to demonstrate time-dependent solutions is implemented for 
enhanced solution visualization. 

## Installation
The following packages are required:
#### numpy 
#### matplotlib
#### mlb_toolkits
Supplementary python files provided by LMU are also required. 

## Usage
For dynamic notebooks, simply run all cells. Parameters may be adjusted to 
view their effects on solutions. Note that solutions may become unstable
for some parameter values.
